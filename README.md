# Football-Team-Stats-Creator

Program written by Hunter Bossetto

This program was an assignment created for class.

This program allows the user to enter the name of a football team, the team's city, and the amount of games that team has won and lost. The program then displays the team name with the city name, the total amount of games the team has played, and the team's winning percentage.
